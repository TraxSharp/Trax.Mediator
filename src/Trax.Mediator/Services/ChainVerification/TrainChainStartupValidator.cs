/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// A chain is a declaration of junction types, so several things are decidable before any traffic
/// arrives: that the chain can be read at all, that every junction's input reaches Memory before
/// the junction needs it, and that every junction it names is one Trax can build (exactly one
/// public constructor, not abstract, not an interface; Trax.Core records those as refusals when
/// the chain is read). Left to runtime, each of those surfaces only on the path that happens to
/// hit it, which for a rarely-taken train can be a long way from deployment.
///
/// <para>Whether a junction's constructor arguments will be found is not checked. A junction takes
/// them from Memory, which the chain fills as it runs, or from the container, and
/// <c>ChainVerification.Verify</c> has no option to replay that yet. A junction whose argument is
/// missing fails on its first run, with a message naming the junction and the type.</para>
///
/// <para>A train that cannot be built at startup is refused when its constructor needs a type the
/// container does not register at all, since that train fails on every run. When everything its
/// constructor names is registered, the failure is taken to be a dependency only a request can
/// supply, and the train is skipped with a warning.</para>
///
/// <para>Every train is checked before anything is reported, so one start tells you about all of
/// them rather than one per attempt. Opt out with
/// <c>AddMediator(m => m.SkipChainVerification())</c> for the blind spot named in
/// <c>ChainVerification</c> (a junction asking for an interface that only a subtype of the
/// train's declared input implements), or temporarily while a codebase whose chains do not pass
/// yet is moved onto <c>Junctions()</c>.</para>
///
/// <para>The check runs in <see cref="StartingAsync"/>, which the host finishes for every hosted
/// service before it calls any <c>StartAsync</c>. A refusal therefore stops the host before a
/// worker starts claiming work, even under <c>HostOptions.ServicesStartConcurrently</c>, where
/// every <c>StartAsync</c> begins at once and registration order decides nothing.</para>
