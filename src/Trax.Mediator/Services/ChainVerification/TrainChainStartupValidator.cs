/// <remarks>
/// A chain is a declaration of junction types, so two things are decidable before any traffic
/// arrives: that the chain can be read at all, and that every junction's input reaches Memory
/// before the junction needs it. Left to runtime, each of those surfaces only on the path that
/// happens to hit it, which for a rarely-taken train can be a long way from deployment.
///
/// <para>Whether a junction can be built is deliberately not checked. A junction takes its
/// constructor arguments from Memory, which the chain fills as it runs, so answering that at
/// startup would mean replaying the resolution rather than the types. An approximation of it
/// rejected every train in the sample applications, all of which run.</para>
///
/// <para>Every train is checked before anything is reported, so one start tells you about all of
/// them rather than one per attempt. Opt out with
/// <c>AddMediator(m => m.SkipChainVerification())</c>, which is worth doing only for the blind
/// spot named in <c>ChainVerification</c>: a junction asking for an interface that only a subtype
/// of the train's declared input implements.</para>
