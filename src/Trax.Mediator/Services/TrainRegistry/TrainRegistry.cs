///
/// The registry uses reflection to discover train implementations in the provided assemblies.
/// It looks for classes that implement the IServiceTrain&lt;TIn, TOut&gt; interface and
/// extracts their input types to build the mapping.
///
/// This implementation supports:
/// - Automatic train discovery via assembly scanning
/// - Interface-based train registration (preferring interfaces over concrete types)
/// - Comprehensive error reporting for invalid train implementations
///
/// The registry is typically created during application startup and registered as a singleton
/// in the dependency injection container, allowing it to be injected into the train bus.
