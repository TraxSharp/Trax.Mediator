Trax.Mediator is the train bus for Trax: run a train by its input type, with every chain checked at host startup. It
builds on [Trax.Effect](https://github.com/TraxSharp/Trax.Effect), and Trax.Scheduler and Trax.Api run their trains
through it.

## Install

```bash
dotnet add package Trax.Mediator
dotnet add package Trax.Effect.Data.Postgres    # or Trax.Effect.Data.Sqlite, Trax.Effect.Data.InMemory
dotnet add package Trax.Mediator.Testing        # optional, architecture guards for your test project
```

Trax.Effect and Trax.Core come in transitively. The storage package is where each run's record is written.

## Example

Adapted from the game server sample. Register the assembly that holds your trains, then hand an input to `ITrainBus`:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddTrax(trax => trax
    .AddEffects(effects => effects.UsePostgres(connectionString))
    .AddMediator(typeof(RecalculateLeaderboardTrain).Assembly));

public class LeaderboardController(ITrainBus trains) : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpPost("leaderboard/{region}/recalculate")]
    public Task<RecalculateLeaderboardOutput> Recalculate(string region) =>
        trains.RunAsync<RecalculateLeaderboardOutput>(
            new RecalculateLeaderboardInput { Region = region });
}
```

The controller never names the train: the bus runs the one registered for `RecalculateLeaderboardInput` and records the
run. A chain that can never be satisfied stops the host at startup.
